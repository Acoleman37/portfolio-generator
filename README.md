# Portfolio Generator
![Badge for GitHub repo top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Acoleman37/employee-db?style=flat&logo=appveyor)
## Description
  
Uses Node.js to build a program that creates an HTML portfolio page, and I did it without ever touching an HTML file! Instead, I used the command line to capture user input and place it in a JavaScript function that provides the finished HTML page as output.
